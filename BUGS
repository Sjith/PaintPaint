* stray dabs on Toro
	* This is a heisenbug :|  If I turn on touch debugging settings in developer options it stops happening
	* Probable fix: Drop dabs too far from last few positions and do extra interpolation for number of dropped dabs
* bad offset for brush from touch position on some devices
	* Confirmed on MB612 (Motorola XPRT) running 2.3.5
	* Confirmed by R3nny on another device running 2.3.5 (Not sure which model)
