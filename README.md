#PaintPaint#

Project for my CS 17.11 Java programming class.  This is a simple painting
program for Android that will provide a basic drawing canvas with support for
saving, sharing, and opening previously worked on images.

This project makes use of the [ActionBar Sherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com)
library which must be included in this project to compile.
